## Why Python?
- There are a lot of reasons for choosing Python. Some reasons include:
- It is a simple computer language that is easy to learn.
- It includes a large number of libraries/modules to help with what it is you are trying to build or do.
- There are a ton of things you can do with Python, including:
    - can read / write / analyze data from databases, spreadsheets, rest API's, and spatial formats
    - web programming
    - data science / data analysis
    - spatial data manipulation and analysis
- It is a stepping stone into computer programming. However, while Python supports more complex programming concepts, understanding of them is not required to get started.
- Building tools / applications in Python is much less cumbersome then many other computer languages and can reduce development time significantly, especially for new programmers.
